# Snowflaker

This filter plugin allows you to generate Twitter [Snowflake IDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_ID) and add them to your logs in Fluentd. 

## Disclaimer
I did not write the original code to generate Snowflake IDs; it's a slightly reworked version of @pmarreck's [Ruby Snowflake ID generator](https://gist.github.com/pmarreck/8049971).
